Code Quiz

## Description

This assignment was to showcase how to create a simple quiz with using primairly Javascript and some HTML and CSS Properties to align and make everything work. The program is allowing the user to take a simple quiz with a timer to ensure to finish the questions in time.

## Usage

For this task, JS or Javascript file was specifically utlized and manipulated the most while HTML and CSS files were used to build and style the website. I had to make the skeleton using html and css and make the box and questions. I orginzied them in div elements making sure I can call them in the JS file. After this in the Javascript, I wrote a function and some code to where I can set a timer for this case for 1 minute and decrement the time 1000 miliseconds so it will count down. From there, I made functions and recalled elements from the html file I can use to make sure the questions and answers are displayed and after every answer wheater right or wrong, the next button would appear. This would ensure the user can click on the button and make sure to move on to the next question. From there, after the final question, I made a promt box of sorts to display to the user their final high score and to try again. The try again button when clicked allowed the user to try the questons again! This task was mainly using JS and refrencing html and css properties to unsure the website talks to eachother.
